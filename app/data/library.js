    title: '1.1 - Acceptance',
    content: '<h2>1.1 ACCEPTANCE</h2>In this section you will learn about therole of acceptance in your life withphysical injuries. Acceptance is aprocess that takes time and can bedefined by common phases.Learning about these steps can helpyou to process your specificsituation.<h2>1.1.1 Who’s On My Team?</h2> Think of adjusting to your physical injuries as a mental game. Like any other game, beating the challenges posed by your injuries takes attitude, determination, and practice. You’ll need to rely on strengths you’ve learned in the past and incorporate new strategies. Sports teams need a coach to teach new skills, monitor progress, and encourage development. You will need the help of a coach, too. Your “coach” is called a therapist. In fact, you may have a whole ros- ter of therapists/ coaches:<ul><li>A physical therapist assists with proper movement and healing to improve physical performance.</li><li>An occupational therapist helps you figure out new ways to take care of yourself. These are referred to as the “activities of daily living.”</li><li>A mental health therapist will help you make adjustments to the changes in your life.</li><li>A spiritual therapist is someone of your faith or belief who can help you understand any conflicts between your beliefs and your experiences.</li></ul>Accept help, but realize that, ultimately, it’s your attitude, practice, and performance that willdetermine how things turn out.<h2>1.1.2 Steps To Acceptance</h2>While deployed, you suffered a debilitating injury and you survived. Now you must cope with the aftermathof injury, which may include loss of body parts, an altered appearance, chronic physical pain,emotional pain, or loss of physical abilities. Learning to adapt to your injuries may be challenging foryou and your loved ones.Be patient with yourself. You need time to process your situation. Experiencing a wide range ofemotions is a natural and important part of the healing process. The way you adapt to your injury willbe influenced by:<ul><li>Your personality.</li><li>Your life experiences.</li><li>Your health before the injury.</li><li>Support from your family and friends.</li><li>The meaning you assign to the event that caused your injury.</li></ul>While coping with injury is a personal process, some aspects of healing after a deployment-relatedinjury are common for everyone. For example, accepting a serious injury means dealing with loss:the loss of body parts or functions; the loss of physical capabilities and skills; the loss of a formeridentity; the loss of mobility; and perhaps the loss of your future plans.In many ways, adjusting to physical injury is like grieving. In fact, you most likely are grieving.<br/>Grieving involves:<ul><li><b>Initial Reaction</b> can take two forms:<ul> <li>Shock: you feel numb and have a hard time accepting the serious nature of your injury.<li>Genuine relief: you feel relief, having survived the event that caused your injury. You mayalso feel relief to be out of the war zone. The initial reaction stage may last several days. </ul><li><b>Denial.</b> You believe the effects of the injury are reversible, and that full recovery is possible.Watch out for “false acceptance,” where you seem to accept your injury but you continue to haveunrealistic and overly-optimistic expectations. False acceptance may be fueled by bravado ratherthan true understanding and acceptance. Denial can last up to a few months.<li><b>Anger.</b> You feel rage at the unfairness of the injury. You may blame others, fate, or God for yourdisabilities.<li><b>Guilt</b> can take the following forms:<ul> <li>You may feel guilty for your part in the event that caused your injury, especially if otherswere injured as well.<li>You may feel guilty for surviving an event where others died. This is known as “survivor’sguilt.” </ul><li><b>Depression.</b> You feel hopeless and down about your injury. You may avoid other people. Youmay feel like staying in bed all day. Or you may have a, “What’s the use?” attitude. It’s commonto feel like this hopeless state will last forever, but it will pass.<li><b>Acceptance.</b> You succeed in coming to terms with your injury and its life-altering impact. Whenyou reach this stage, you’re ready to stop looking to the past and the way things might have been.You’ll know you’ve reached this stage when you begin to concentrate on areas of your life otherthan your injury. You may start thinking about the practical aspects of life, looking forward toevents, your current abilities and progress, and life goals. The world will be bigger than your injury and you will begin to see possibilities.</li></ul> Grieving is different for everybody. Some people move through the stages of grief in a different order. Some people don’t experience every stage of grief, while others will go through certain stages more than once. It helps to talk to other service members who’ve suffered injuries like yours.<br/><br/> Allow yourself to feel all emotions. The painful emotions of the grieving process are normal and natural. Getting emotional doesn’t mean you’re weak. Prepare to feel angry, guilty, sad, and hopeless. But take heart—these emotions will pass. Typically, the grieving process can take anywhere from several months to two years.The length of your grieving process largely depends on:<ul><li>The severity of your injury.</li><li>The severity of your disability.</li><li>Your pre-injury character (who you were before the injury).</li></ul>Everyone has a different recovery timeframe; taking longer to reach the acceptance period than someoneelse doesn’t mean you’re weak.<h2>1.1.3 Redefining Who You Are</h2>Like other injured service members, you will likely respond to your injury in two distinct phases. The firstphase is your response to the injury and the trauma that caused it. The second phase is your responseto your recovery. Once you’ve grieved the loss of your old self and accepted your new physical appearanceand abilities, you may discover new interests and opportunities.<br/><br/>You’ll find that you can adapt to enjoy some of your old activities. And you’ll probably discover new interestsand activities along the way. Some people describe this experience as a rebirth. Once you enterthis stage, you’ll discover how many things you can do that you hadn’t thought possible because of yourinjury.<h2>1.1.4 Changing Your Self-Image</h2>Your self-image comes from the way you feel about:<ul><li>Your appearance.</li><li>Your skills and abilities.</li><li>Your role in relationships with others.</li><li>Your worth as a person.</li></ul>A positive self-image is important in order to:<ul><li>Achieve personal and professional goals inyour life.</li><li>Have healthy social relationships with familyand friends.</li><li>Promote your own health and recovery frominjury.</li></ul>If your deployment injuries left you disabled or disfigured, you might compare your appearance orabilities with those of people around you. Or you may compare the way you look and function now tothey way you looked and functioned before your injury. These kinds of comparisons are normal andnatural. But, to recover and thrive, you need to develop a new self-image apart from those comparisons.Developing a positive self-image after an injury may take a while, so be patient. You will need to:<ul><li>Give up your old, pre-injury self-image.</li><li>Accept your new body (including a prosthetic if you have an amputation).</li><li>Combat the stereotypes of “physical perfection.”</li></ul><b>Giving up the old image of yourself before you were injured.</b><br/>As a service member trained to stay in shape, you may base your self-esteem on your physicalappearance and abilities. However, your physical self is just one aspect of your total self. These twoexercises can help you keep your physical appearance and abilities in perspective.<hr><b>Exercise #1</b>: In your mind, picture yourself at different times in your life. Think about how you lookedwhen you were a child, a young teenager, and as an adult before you were injured. This exercise helpsyou remember what your body was like before the injury while you transfer those images to the past.You are now in a new phase of life. <br/><br/><b>Exercise #2</b>: List your top six personal qualities. These can be character traits, the way you interactwith other people, your ability to handle problems, and so forth. Only one of the six qualities shouldrelate to your appearance or physical capabilities. Read this list each morning. These qualitiescharacterize you as a person. This exercise will reduce the importance of your appearance and physicalabilities and increase your focus on your character.<hr><b>Accepting your new body image.</b><br/> Some service members claim to accept their injuries. But when they picture themselves, they don’t acknowledge their injury. To fully recover, you need to visualize and accept your appearance with the injury. Exercise #3 can help you accept your new body image.<br><br> <b>Exercise #3</b>: Look in a mirror each day for at least five minutes with your injuries in full view. As you look at yourself, repeat the following phrases: “I accept myself.” , “I am strong.” , “This body works for me and I work for my body.”<br/><br/> This exercise will help you accept and get comfortable with your new body image.<br/><br/><b>Fighting the stereotyped images of “physical perfection.”</b><br/> When you show no self-consciousness in front of others, you educate others and help them overcome our culture’s misguided emphasis on “physical perfection.”<h2>1.1.5 Making Sense Of Your Injury</h2>One of the toughest jobs related to adjusting to war injuries is to make sense out of the injury and why it happened. Servicemembers who find positive meaning in their sacrifice and fit their injury into their world view have a greater sense of wellbeingand less anxiety and depression.Making sense of your injury may take days, weeks, or months. Think of the ways your injury has positive affects on your life.<ol> <li><b>Search for a positive direction that you could pursue because of your injury.</b></li><ul> <li>Have you learned to appreciate small things you used to take for granted?</li><li>Have you formed new relationships or grown closer to loved ones?</li><li>Has the injury increased your wisdom or faith?</li><li>Have you learned new skills you didn’t have before?</li><li>Are you stronger and more resilient than you thought you could be?</li></ul> <li><b>Look to your faith to help you find meaning.</b></li><li><b>Find a new purpose for your life in light of your injury.</b> This might be an immediate purpose, like turning an ordinaryevent into something special and significant. Or it might be a long-term purpose, like helping other injured people get their lives back on track.</li></ol><h2>1.1.6 Setting Goals For The Future</h2>Once you accept and make sense of your injury, you can start to see your life in terms of possibilities, instead of limitations.Begin to set goals for the future. Goal-setting is important for both your physical recovery and for positive mental health.Setting goals will give you a sense of purpose and help you focus on your future. Here are some steps to goal-setting thatwill help you plan for a positive future:<br/><br/><b>Choose the goal:</b><ul><li>Write out your goal: “My goal is to …”</li><li>Make sure the goal is yours, not someone else’s. Don’t set goals basedon what you think society expects you to do.</li><li>Make your goal as specific as possible. Too General: “My goal is to starthiking again. ”Specific: “My goal is to climb Mt. Whitney.”</li></ul><b>Create a completion plan</b><ul><li>Write down all the intermediate steps required to accomplish your goal. This may take some research.</li></ul>Example: An IED explosion cost John his left leg. Followinghis recovery from the amputation, John set a goal to climb Mt.Whitney. Check out his completion plan.<ul><li><b>Get the correct prosthetic.</b></li><li><b>Learn to walk without crutches.</b></li><li><b>Train on flat ground using the correct prosthetic.</b></li><li><b>Train in foothills.</b></li><li><b>Increase endurance.</b></li><li><b>Find and train with a hiking club.</b></li><li><b>Get equipment for the hike.</b></li></ul> List your intermediate goalschronologically. John put his goals in chronological order,so each step in his plan logically followed the step before it.For instance, increasing John’s endurance came aftertraining first on flat ground and then in foothills. Make a listof what you need to do to accomplish the first step.</li><br/><i>Example</i>: The first step in John’s plan is to “Get the correctprosthetic.” John must contact other amputee hikers, researchonline, find a company that makes hiking prosthetics, get fitted,and find a way to pay for the prosthetic.<ul><li><b>Set a timetable to complete the steps.</b> Plan a target date to accomplish the big goal.</li><li><b>Schedule time for delays and setbacks.</b> If you plan forsetbacks ahead of time, they won’t upset you as much.</li><li><b>Put it all in writing.</b> “My goal is to climb Mt. Whitney byAugust of next year. The intermediate steps and the datesfor their completion are: …”</li><li><b>Do a reality check.</b></li><ul> <li>Make your plan challenging but not impossible.</li><li>Make a plan that works within your budget and schedule.</li></ul><li><b>Begin as soon as possible, but pace yourself</b></li><ul><li>Many people begin working toward their goal at a pace they can’t maintain.</li><li>Move slowly and steadily toward your goal.</li><li>Keep the journey toward your goal a priority.</li></ul>',

    title: '1.2 - Returning to Community',
    content: '<h2>1.2 RETURNING TO COMMUNITY</h2>After accepting your injury and setting newexpectations for the future, you need to “get backout there.” Return to your community. Some ofthe most important factors in creating a highquality of life include:<ul><li>Maintaining healthy relationships with others.</li><li>Finding or continuing employment that is personally and financially rewarding.</li><li>Participating in your community.</li><li>Enjoying recreational activities</li></ul><h2>1.2.1 Building Satisfactory Relationships</h2>Injured or disabled service members may need to learnnew ways of interacting with others. They may alsoneed to develop new skills to deal with uncomfortable orunfamiliar situations, such as: <ul> <li>Handling unwanted attention effectively.</li><li>Asking for help and making requests in a direct and open way.</li><li>Developing new relationships.</li></ul><b>Handling unwanted attention</b>: Visible injuries includeburns and amputations. Wheelchairs also indicate aninjury or disability. Visible injuries attract more attention.At first, you may feel uncomfortable in public:<ol type="a"><li>When someone stares at you.</li><li>When someone is curious about your injury.</li><li>When someone makes fun of your injury.</li></ol><b>a) When someone stares:</b><br><i>Accept it as part of human nature.</i> People naturally payattention to anything out of the ordinary, so yourinjuries may draw attention. Expect some people tostare at you. But most people will stare out of curiosity,compassion, or concern – not rudeness.<br><br><i>Retain control over the situation.</i> Don’t give power overyour life to strangers. You can’t control their staring butyou can control your reaction. Don’t allow otherpeople’s reactions to prevent you from living a good life.Use <b>The STEPS tool.</b><br><br><b>S</b>=Self-talk (make it positive) -“I accept myself and I’m comfortablewith other people.”<br><b>T</b>=Tone of voice - friendly, warm,enthusiastic.<br><b>E</b>=Eye contact – look people inthe eye.<br><b>P</b>=Posture – head raised,shoulders back.<br><b>S</b>=Smile – confident butapproachable.<br><br>Whenever you are out in public or enter a new socialsituation, you can influence the way people respondto you by projecting confidence. When people seeyou are self-assured and friendly, they will focus onyour personality instead of your injuries. Practice thefollowing steps until they become natural andautomatic. You may want to practice daily in front ofa mirror<br><br><b>b) When someone is curious about your injury:</b> when people ask about your injury, have ananswer ready. This will reduce any embarrassment or anger you might feel. And it will make the situationless awkward. Rehearse your response until it feels natural and friendly (not hostile). If someoneasks for more information and you don’t feel like talking about it, have a response ready for that, too:<i>“That’s all I care to say about it today. I’m sure you understand.”</i><hr>Here’s an example: <i>“I was injured in an explosion in Baghdad. I was in the hospital for a couple of months, but I’m doing better now. Thanks for asking.”</i><br>This answer consists of three sentences:Sentence # 1 states how, when, or where you were injured: <i>“I was injured in an explosion in Baghdad.”</i><br>Sentence # 2 states how you are doing now: <i>“I’m doing better now.” Or: “I have one more surgery but I’m doing better.”</i><br>Sentence # 3 states your appreciation for the other person’s concern and closes the topic: <i>“Thanks for asking.” Or: “Thank you for your concern.”</i><br><hr><b>c) When someone makes fun of your injury:</b> some people’s comments are not so well-intentioned.Someone may purposely taunt you or poke fun at your disability. And you may feel the urge to getrevenge or defend yourself. But either response will fuel the other person’s wishes. Instead, yourresponse should: stop the other person from harassing you, and maintain your self-respect. Use one of two these techniques: <b>IGNORE put-downs and Use humor to diffuse the situation.</b><br><br><i><b>IGNORE put-downs:</b></i> this option is difficult for service members trained in combat rather thancompromise. Most people make fun of others out of insecurity. Insecure people point out theimperfections of others to feel better about their own shortcomings. By ignoring the put-downs, you keepthe one thing the other person wants—control. The put-downs will eventually stop when the other personrealizes they can’t get a reaction out of you. As a bonus, everyone else will respect the mature way youhandle the situation.<br><br><i><b>Use humor to diffuse the situation.</b></i> If you feel you need to respond to an insult (for instance if you arein a social situation where ignoring the other person is difficult or inappropriate), find a humorous response.Again, plan your response and practice it ahead of time.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Robert suffered severe upper body burns during deployment, leaving him with extensive scarringon his face and hands. While eating an ice cream cone with his younger brother in a local park, Robert isapproached by a group of teenagers. One of them shouts: “Hey, Dude! Don’t look now, but someone stoleyour face.” Robert merely shrugs and says: “Yeah, I guess I got too much sun on that beach in Iraq lastyear.” Robert’s humorous line diffused the situation and won the respect of onlookers (like his brother).<br><br><b>Use negative assertion to diffuse the situation.</b> Negative assertion means acknowledging truth in theput-down while turning it into a positive statement.<br><br><b>Example:</b> in another situation, Robert used negative assertion.Put-down: <i>“Hey, Dude, it must be pretty hard to eat ice cream with that face.”</i><br>Robert’s Response: <i>“You’re not kidding. It was hard to eat for a long time after the explosion, but I’m getting better at it now.”</i><br><br>Robert’s negative assertion showed he was not intimidated by the put-down. Instead, he diffused a potentiallydifficult situation. Prepare and practice negative assertions ahead of time. The goal of responding to aput-down should be to diffuse—not aggravate—the situation.<br><br><b>Ask for help, and make direct and open requests:</b> your goal as an injured service member is to becomeas independent as possible. However, there may be times when you need help. Ask for help in a direct,assertive, and unembarrassed manner. Asking for help indirectly frustrates others, makes you seeminsecure, and prevents people from helping when they can’t figure out what you need. Direct requests havethree parts:<ul><li>State your needs: “I need to get to the doctor’s office tomorrow.”</li><li>Make the request: “Would you be able to drive me?”</li><li>Acknowledge the other person’s response: “Thank you, I really appreciate it.”Exercise: Make alist of areas where you need help. Then write a script with a direct request for each item, usingthe three-part request approach listed above. Finally, practice each request until it becomesautomatic. The next time you ask for help, you’ll be able to ask in a direct, confident, and openmanner. </li></ul><b>Developing new Relationships</b>: having a broad base of social support is vitally important for injuredservice members. Relationships keep you from becoming withdrawn or isolated. Friends, family, andcoworkers can sustain you through your physical recovery. Their support will make your daily triumphs moremeaningful. You may meet many new friends in the hospital, at support groups, and in recreational orcommunity activities (see below). To build and maintain positive relationships:<ul><li>Remember to use the STEPS Tool. Practice the following steps until they become natural and automatic.</li><li>Be a good listener. Instead of planning what to say while the other person is speaking, listen carefully.Every once in a while, repeat what they’re saying in your own words. Use phrases like “What I hear yousaying is…” or “You seem to be saying…Is that right?” This helps the other person feel understood.</li></ul>Ask questions that show you are interested in the whole person, not just their work or their deployment experience.Everyone has a unique personal story to tell if you act interested. If you follow these guidelines,people will know you are comfortable with your injury and interested in getting to know them.<h2>1.2.2 Employment</h2>Finding or returning to employment is one of the most important aspects of adjusting to an injury.Employment will increase your self-esteem, personal independence, and financial security. Askyourself these questions when looking for employment.<ul><li>Are you capable of returning to the job you formerly held? If not, are you able to work in a related</li>area where your expertise can be valuable?<li>Would you prefer to work in a different field from your former employment? If so, what training or education will you need? Is it realistic to pursue this training or education?</li><li>Does the new job have advancement potential? Does it offer training? Is there room for growth?</li><li>Are you interested in this field? Or is this “just a job”? You will perform better and find more satisfaction in a job that really “calls” to you.</li></ul><b>People with disabilities cannot be denied employment just becausethey’re disabled if they can perform the essential duties of the position.</b><br><br>For more information on employment and disability, visit the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Disability Employment Policy Website at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/odep/pubs/fact/laws.htm">http://www.dol.gov/odep/pubs/fact/laws.htm</a> <h2>1.2.3 Compensation Issues</h2>As an injured service member or veteran, you may qualify for compensation.

    title: '1.3 - Managing Pain',
    content: '<h2>1.3 MANAGING PAIN</h2>In this section you will learn aboutdifferent types of pain and how thetype influences in how you manageand treat pain you or a loved one issuffering from. You will learndifferent strategies for managingpain and other resources availableto help you.<h2>1.3.1 Is All Pain The Same?</h2>When you were injured you felt the pain caused bytissue damage, called nociceptive pain or acute pain.This type of pain is the same whether the tissue injurywas caused by burn, broken bones, gunshot wound, oramputation. You may still feel acute pain during thehealing process, dressing changes, physical therapy,or when you “overdo it” before you are completelyhealed.<br><br>You may still feel pain, even after you completely heal.This type of pain is called neuropathic, or chronic,pain. With chronic pain, your nerves continue to carrya pain signal even though the tissue damage hashealed. It is possible to feel acute and chronic pain atthe same time. This may happen during recovery fromburns or with musculoskeletal injuries.<br><br>If you have experienced poorly managed pain for along time, you may have developed chronic pain syndrome.Chronic pain syndrome is a combination of neuropathic pain, myofascial pain (pain fromconstantly tensed or contracted muscles), worry, and lack of exercise and poor sleep.<br><br>Many service members have pain from the wear and tear on the body from military service. In thecourse of their duties, Service members lift, pull, haul, and jump—often in full battle rattle. Theseactivities can cause a variety of injuries that aren’t as obvious as amputations or burns. But the painfrom these activities can significantly interfere with your ability to function. These conditions may alsocause you to develop chronic pain syndrome. Experts can treat acute pain and chronic pain.<h2>1.3.2 Managing Acute Pain</h2>Acute pain may require opiate (narcotic)medication. Your treatment team shouldconsider other strategies and medicationsto reduce your pain, minimize the amountof opiate you require, and help you feelbetter. It may not be possible to eliminateall your pain. But your treatment teamshould manage your pain well enoughthat you can sleep, watch t.v., read,interact with family, and participate intherapy.<b>Important information about opiates (narcotics):</b><br>Some people who take prescription opiates for pain worrythey will get addicted. Most develop a <b>tolerance</b> toopiates. Tolerance means your body has adjusted to thedose and needs more medication to get the same amountof pain relief. Eventually the amount of medication youneed will stabilize. Unless your pain reaches a pointwhere you need <b>breakthrough pain medication</b>, yourdose will likely remain stable.<br><br>If your doctor keeps you on opiates for a while, you maybecome <b>dependent</b>. Being dependent just means thatyou cannot suddenly stop (quit “cold turkey”) taking yourmedication without suffering the unpleasant effects ofwithdrawal. As you heal and progress in physicaltherapy, your treatment team will slowly reduce your doseof medication to help you avoid withdrawal. Toleranceand dependence alone do not mean that you have an<b>addiction</b> or <b>substance abuse problems</b>. However, <b>you have a problem if:</b><ul><li>You exaggerate—or even lie about—your pain level to get more medication.</li><li>You spend your time trying to find ways to get more medication when your pain is already under control.</li><li>You want medication because you enjoy feeling “high.”</li><li>You use the medication to avoid loneliness,sadness, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress.</li></ul>Many service members who develop an addiction to painmedication have had trouble with other substances like alcohol.<br><br>You deserve to have your pain treated. Pain slowshealing, and poorly-controlled pain may actuallycontribute to chronic pain. So take your medication asprescribed. Be honest about how much pain you have,and describe it as accurately as possible when asked byyour caregivers. If your medication works briefly, butyour pain gets worse long before the next dose, let yourtreatment team know. This is relief-seeking, notdrug-seeking. And you have a right to control your pain.<br><br><b>Other types of medication:</b> Your muscles may tense orcontract because of your pain. This can increase yourpain level, so your treatment team may prescribemedication to relax your muscles. The team may alsoprescribe anti-depressants for anxiety, since anxiety (anddepression) can increase your pain level as well. If yourpain keeps you from sleeping well, your treatment teammay also prescribe sleep medication. Sleep is critical topain control because it affects your ability to deal withpain during the day.<br><br><b>Acute Pain Service:</b> If normal treatments can’t reduceyour pain, your treatment team may seek help from aspecialist in Pain Medicine. Many military and VAfacilities have pain specialists who help manage and treatdifficult pain from injuries or surgery. Besides prescribingpain medications, these specialists can provide specialprocedures to reduce specific types of acute pain.<br><br><b>Pain Psychologists:</b> Some clinical psychologists aretrained to help to reduce your pain. If your treatmentteam consults a psychologist, it doesn’t mean they thinkyour pain is not real or that it’s “all in your head.” Yourbrain processes the pain signals from your body. Somepsychological tools, such as hypnosis, can alter the wayyour brain receives pain signals. Psychologists can alsoaddress any anxiety, depression, or poor sleep issuesthat affect your pain control. These specialists can alsosupply videos, video games, and music to distract yourbrain from pain signals and reduce your pain.Psychologists can help you understand your treatmentplan so you worry less about it.<h2>1.3.3 Managing Chronic Pain</h2>Depending on your length of service and your duties, you may have a combination of acute pain (likedegenerative joint disease in your feet, knees, hips, and back) and chronic pain. As you get older, yourjoints continue to degenerate. <b>Your condition may get worse if you don’t make it better!</b><br><br>To successfully manage your pain, delay further deterioration, and maintain a good quality of life, youneed to understand your situation and create a plan to deal with it.<br><br>What is going on? If you have suffered from acute pain for a long time, your central nervous system mayhave adapted to transmitting a constant pain signal. You may continue to feel pain even though the tissueinjury (which initially caused the pain) has healed. Your medical providers may even say your problem hasbeen addressed and they no longer detect a reason for your pain.<br><br>Your brain responds to all pain signals the same, whether the pain is from a tissue injury or something else.That brain responds to pain by directing you to stop the cause of injury or seek help. Pain is supposed to“bother” you. With constant pain, your brain “bothers” you even when you’re not suffering the effects of atissue injury. This brain response is known as neuropathic pain - one component of a chronic painsyndrome.<br><br>When you experience chronic pain, your stress response system causes the muscles around the source ofpain to contract. Physical therapists call this “bracing.” Because pain also causes mental stress, your bodyresponds with more muscle contractions or ‘tension’. Muscles that contract or tense for a long timebecome painful. We call this type of pain myofascial pain. Myo refers to muscle. Fascia is the thin sheetof connective tissue that covers the muscle. Myofascial pain causes large areas of soreness and pain. Itoften triggers headaches when located in the upper back, neck and head muscles. This is a secondcomponent of a chronic pain syndrome. <br><br>While on active duty you were physically active. You mayhave abruptly stopped that activity with the onset of pain.The normal response to pain is to stop moving. Thisresponse is helpful with tissue injuries, because it mayprevent more injury or blood loss. But when you are notsuffering from a tissue injury, not moving can lead to injurywhen your body becomes weak or de-conditioned. Lack ofmovement can also cause weight gain, putting an additionalstrain on your back and joints.<br><br>By not moving, you are also depriving yourself of a major stress reliever at a time when you may beupset or stressed. This is yet another component of chronic pain syndrome.<br><br>Stress, pain, and weight gain can interfere with sleep indifferent ways. Healthy people with no pain will developpain if they are deprived of deep sleep. If you wake up withpain, suffer chronic nightmares, or have a serious snoringor breathing (sleep apnea) problem, your ability to managepain will suffer during the day. These conditions may evenlead to additional pain symptoms. This is the last majorcomponent of chronic pain syndrome.<br><br><b>What needs to be done?</b> With chronic pain syndrome,there are a number of processes working together to keepyou in pain. Your treatment team can help you with someparts of your chronic pain, but much of this problem onlyyou can handle.<br><br><b>Medication:</b> even though your treatment team may have prescribed opiates for your pain, there areother medications that can help with pain. This may include anticonvulsants, such as Topamax,Neurontin, and Lyrica. While originally designed to treat seizure disorders like epilepsy, anticonvulsantscan also reduce neuropathic pain.<br><br>Some antidepressants have also been found to be very useful. Small doses of older anti-depressants, like Elavil, decrease nerve pain and promote good sleep. A newer antidepressant, Cymbalta, specifically treats neuropathic pain even if you’re not depressed. Your medical provider can answer your questions about the right medications for your treatment.<br><br>Your medical provider should also assess whether you suffer from sleep apnea or other sleep disorders, such asrestless leg syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder. You may need to be evaluated in a sleepstudy. Post-traumatic stress can cause nightmares that may interfere with sleep.<br><br><b>Chronic Pain Service:</b> along with treating difficult acute pain problems, pain doctors also specialize intreating chronic pain problems. They have a variety of procedures that may reduce your pain if youhave developed a specific chronic pain problem. Doctors may also prescribe medications and injectionsto relax muscles and reduce myofascial pain.<br><br><b>Reduce muscle contraction:</b> you must learn to manage stress and treat any post-traumatic stress symptoms. If you haverelationship problems that cause more stress, you should consider counseling. Money worries can also increase musclecontractions and myofascial pain. Identify all of the stressors in your life and look for ways to begin reducing that stress.<br><br>Many techniques that reduce pain also reduce muscle contractions. Some techniquesmay not work for you or suit your personality. You may find other techniques surprisinglyeffective in reducing your pain. Experiment to see what works for you.<br><br>Heat relaxes muscles and reduces myofascial pain. Hot showers, baths andcompresses are all effective ways to prevent muscle contractions and control pain.<br><br>A daily stretching program works directly against chronic muscle contraction and preventsthe onset of some pain conditions like hip bursitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.<br><br><b>Reconditioning:</b> your physical therapist may have given you some exercises to do on your own. You need a personalizedexercise program to promote fitness, decrease the risk of injury, support your joints and back, and decrease stress. Have anexercise physiologist design a program for you that:<ol><li>accounts for your physical problems</li><li>works for you</li><li>is fun</li></ol>Your exercise program should include stretching,resistance exercise, and an aerobic component. Youwon’t feel like moving when you are in pain, so you’llhave to push through the pain. Go slow and build upgradually.<br><br><b>Sleep:</b> sleep medication will only work consistently if you have a regular sleep pattern. If you do not work toward a regularcycle, your brain won’t know when it is time to shut down for sleep. Stick with a sleep cycle that you like. It’s also importantnot to nap longer than 30 minutes.<br><br>If you think you have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), get tested by a behavioral health professional. PTSDsymptoms (including recurring memories of the traumatic event, avoidance behavior, and irritability) interfere withpain management.<h2>1.3.4 Strategies for Managing Pain</h2><ul><li>MEDICATIONS</li><li>HEAT AND COLD COMPRESSES</li><li>ACUPUNCTURE/ACUPRESSURE/MASSAGE</li><li>ELECTRICAL STIMULATION</li><li>AUTOHYPNOSIS</li><li>VIRTUAL REALITY</li><li>STRESS REDUCTION</li><li>PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</li></ul><b>Medications/Narcotics:</b><ul><li>The class of opioid-based drugs including morphine, oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl.</li><li>Used for acute pain, such as pain after an amputation or burn surgery.</li><li>Also used for chronic pain in low doses if other methods are not effective.</li><li>Side effects may include sedation, nausea and vomiting, and hallucinations.</li><li>Since they are habit-forming, opioids must be prescribedand used with extreme care under professional medical supervision.</li></ul><b>Anti-inflammatory Drugs:</b><ul><li>Includes aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve).</li><li>Reduces swelling, irritation, and pain.</li><li>Also includes prescription steroidal drugs (cortisone andprednisone) for treating more serious inflammatory ? conditions.</li></ul><b>Antidepressants:</b><ul><li>Used for chronic pain and pain due to nerve damage in SCI or amputation.</li><li>Newer medications (like Cymbalta) are particularly helpful.</li><li>May also help induce restful sleep.</li></ul><b>Anti-seizure medications:</b><ul><li>Used for chronic pain.</li><li>May relieve what some patients describe as "shooting" or“burning” pain caused by damaged nerves and aching pain.</li></ul><b>Injections:</b><ul><li>Local anesthetics (such as Novocain) can be injected around nerve roots and directly into muscles or joints.</li><li>Used to reduce swelling, muscle spasms and abnormal nerve activity that can cause pain.</li></ul> <b>Heat Compresses:</b><ul><li>Electric heating pad or hot water bottle applied to the site of the pain may give relief.</li><li>Heat above 104F blocks the body’s ability to detect pain.</li><li>Increases blood flow to the injured area, bringing nutrients to damaged tissues.</li><li>Also reduces joint and muscle stiffness.</li></ul> <b>NOTE:</b> Heat should not be applied immediately after aninjury.<br><br><b>Cold Compresses:</b><ul><li>Relieves pain by numbing the affected area.</li><li>Reduces swelling and inflammation.</li><li>Reduces bleeding.</li></ul>Some people find more relief with cold compresses than withheat and vice versa.

    title: '1.4 - Sexual Issues',
    content: '<h2>1.4 SEXUAL ISSUES</h2>Humans are sexual beings. This does not change just because of serious injury. But seriousinjuries can change the way an injured person expresses their sexuality. Regaining a satisfactorysex life is an important ingredient of healthy post-deployment adjustment for an injured person andtheir partner. Communicate openly and honestly with your sexual partner as you work to return toa fulfilling sex life. Deployment injuries may lead to sexual problems in the following areas whichwill be discussed in this section:<ul><li>Pain.</li><li>Fatigue.</li><li>Erectile dysfunction.</li><li>Loss of desire.</li><li>Lubrication issues.</li><li>Problems with bowel and bladder control.</li></ul><h2>1.4.1 Pain</h2>Chronic or acute pain may interfere with sexual desire and performance. You may have to deal withchronic pain issues before resuming a satisfactory sex life (see the Managing Pain section). If you’re afemale with an injury and you have genital pain (dyspareunia), you should see a specialist—the problemis sometimes associated with psychiatric issues and may need specific treatment. <h2>1.4.2 Loss of Desire</h2>Loss of sexual desire after a deployment injury is common and may be caused by</b> a number of differentfactors, including: depression or anxiety, antidepressant or pain medications, pain, fatigue, or loss ofsensation to the primary sex organs (as in the case of spinal cord injuries). Psychological factors, suchas trust issues and low self-esteem, can also decrease sexual desire.<br><br><b>Depression</b> – Loss of sexual desire and depression often go hand in hand. If you are depressed,your interest in many pleasurable activities may suffer. As your depression lifts, your sexual desireshould return.<br><br><b>Antidepressant and pain medication</b> – Reduced sexual desires are often a side effect ofantidepressants. If you take anti-depressants, tell your doctor if you are having sexual difficulties. Sexualside effects can interfere with your recovery from depression. Your doctor may change the drugs you aretaking, change the dosage, or add a small dose of another medication (e.g. bupropion) to help increaseyour sexual desire. Even if you are not depressed, check your medications if you are having desireproblems. You may take an antidepressant for pain.<br><br><b>Fatigue</b> – Fatigue negatively affects sexual desire. Fatigue may result from long hospital stays (whereadequate sleep is difficult), constantly fighting pain, rehabilitation and physical therapy, or other forms ofstress. Getting the proper amount of rest and using stress reduction techniques may help restore yoursexual desire to pre-injury levels.<br><br><b>Loss of sensation</b> – If you have spinal cord injuries or severe burns, you may have lost sensation inyour primary sexual organs. Loss of sensation may temporarily interfere with sexual desire becausesexual activity does not produce the same amount of stimulation as before the injury. But many peoplefind that other non-sexual areas of their body become sexually sensitive if they lose their primary sexualsensitivity. You may need to experiment to find which of your body parts now give you the most sensualpleasure. The earlobe, neck, hands, lips, or other body parts may take over as sources of sexualexcitement.<br><br><b>Trust issues</b> – Dealing with changes in your sexual functioning may affect trust in a relationship.Talking openly and honestly with your sexual partner is crucial. Making assumptions or “settling for less”in your intimate relationship can damage the trust between you and your partner. Communication is thekey. Instead of feeling embarrassed and avoiding the topic, have open conversations about yourchanges in sexuality. You may want to use humor. Counselors or psychologists can help with thisadjustment phase.<br><br><b>Body image problems</b> – If you are uncomfortablewith the way your body looks after your injury, you willprobably take your discomfort into your sexual relationship.Self-consciousness may affect your level of sexual desire.Check the Redefining the Self section for suggestions onhow to feel more comfortable with your body image.<br><br><b>Change in role within the family</b> – Another issuethat may affect the level of sexual desire is a change of yourrole within the family. This issue is usually more serious formales than females. If you are used to being in control (thehead-of-household) and you find that others have taken overtasks that used to be yours, you may suffer from a loss ofself-esteem. Low self-esteem can affect your sexual desire.The best way to deal with this issue is to strive for independence.<h2>1.4.3 Erectile Dysfunction</h2><b>Drugs (Viagra, Levitra)</b> – New erectile dysfunctiondrugs have proven to be helpful for males having difficultygetting and keeping erections due to injuries.<br><br><b>Vacuum method</b> – A vacuum pump is placed over thepenis, causing the blood vessels to inflate. A band is placedat the base of the penis to keep those blood vessels inflated.This method is non-invasive and should be consideredbefore injections or implants.<br><br><b>Injections</b> – A small needle injects a prescribedvasoactive medication into the penis. This causes the bloodvessels to enlarge and results in an erection that lasts from15 minutes to an hour. The needle causes little or nodiscomfort. Potential side effects include bruising at theinjection site or priapism (a persistent, often painful,erection that lasts more than four hours). Insurance maycover this option.<br><br><b>Penile implant/prosthesis</b> - Most men who toleratepenile implants are satisfied with the results. However,about 10 percent experience problems and must have theimplants removed. Unfortunately, the men who have thedevice removed may find that other erectile dysfunctiontreatments no longer work because the removal processmay damage penile tissue. So consider this method a lastresort.<h2>1.4.4 Female and Lower Body Injuries</h2>Women with lower body injuries, especially spinal cordinjuries, are generally able to have sexual intercourse aseasily as before the injury. A lubricant (commerciallyavailable) may make intercourse easier and to preventchafing.<h2>1.4.5 Problems with Bowel And Bladder Issues</h2>Bowel and bladder management are extremely importantfor people with spinal cord injuries. This may includemanaging catheters or ostomies. Emptying your bladderbefore sex helps to avoid the urge to urinate during sex.Avoid intense genital or anal stimulation when you havea full bowel, as this may also stimulate an unscheduledbowel movement. If you worry about your bowel orbladder, always keep blue pads or “chux” nearby.<br><br>Both men and women with indwelling catheters can leavethe catheter in during sex. For men, the catheter can befolded along the penis and held in place with a condomor tape. For women, the catheter can be taped to thelower abdomen. If you are at risk for autonomicdysreflexia (AD), remember that stimulation or orgasmcan trigger AD. Talk to your doctor about treatments toprevent this problem.<br><br><b><i>As you increase your independence and develop more confidence in your post-injury abilities, your growing self-esteem will positively affect your sexual desire.</i></b><br><br>To get the best results, you’ll need to communicate openly with your doctor. You may need to bringup the topic of sexual functioning. Be assertive, ask questions, do your research, and follow throughon recommendations. Communicating with your spouse or partner is just as important. You’ll need towork together to deal with your injury. Keep in mind the following points:<ul><li>Sex may be less spontaneous than it was before your injury. You may need to plan ahead to handle fatigue, pain, or bowel and bladder routines.</li><li>You may have to try different positions or have your partner take a more active role.</li><li>You may have to experiment with different pleasure zones on the body. And you may need to rely more on non-intercourse types of sexual activity.</li></ul><b>Adjusting to changes in your sexual functioning takes time. But with an open mind and open communication with your spouse and your doctor, you can look forward to an active and positive sex life.</b><h2>1.4.6 Fertility Issues</h2>People with spinal cord injuries may experience significant fertility issues. The two most commonproblems are difficulty with ejaculation and poor sperm quality. While not much can be done toimprove the sperm quality, there are two common procedures address difficulty with ejaculation:<ul> <li><b>Penile vibratory stimulation (PVS)</b> – In this procedure, a mechanical vibrator is placedat the base of the penis and vibrates at a designated frequency, inducing a reflexejaculation.</li><li><b>Electroejaculation stimulation (EES)</b> - In this procedure (usually performed under generalanesthesia), an electric probe is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. A smallelectrical current stimulates the nerves and leads to ejaculation and the collection ofsperm.</li><li><b>In vitro fertilization (IVF)</b> – When sperm quality is low, in vitro procedures may beeffective by injecting a single sperm directly into an egg taken from the female. The fertilized egg is then placed back in the uterus.</li></ul>If you or your partner want to get pregnant, ask your doctor for a referral to a fertility clinic thatspecializes in disability, illness, or spinal cord injury.',
