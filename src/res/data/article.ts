    text: '<h2>Dealing with Pain</h2>Controlling pain is an essential step to regaining a sense of well-being after a deployment injury. There are two major categories of pain: chronic and acute. Pain that exists after an injury has healed is called chronic pain.<br><br>Chronic pain can include the central pain associated with spinal cord injuries, phantom limb pain, and other types of neuropathic pain (pain caused by damage to nerves or nerve dysfunction). Pain resulting from tissue injury such as combat injury, surgery, or the treatment of burns is acute pain and is treated differently from chronic pain. There are a number of different types of treatment for controlling pain available today, including:<ul><li>Medications.</li><li>Hot and Cold Compresses.</li><li>Acupuncture, Acupressure, and Massage.</li><li>Electrical Stimulation.</li><li>Autohypnosis.</li><li>Virtual Reality.</li><li>Stress Reduction.</li><li>Physical Activity.</li></ul><h3>Medications</h3><b>Narcotics</b><ul><li>The class of opioid-based drugs including morphine, oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl.</li><li>Used for acute pain, such as post-surgical pain after amputation or burn surgery.</li><li>Also used for chronic pain in low doses if other methods are not effective.</li><li>Side effects may include sedation, nausea and vomiting, and possible hallucinations.</li><li>Because they are habit-forming, opioids must be prescribed and used with extreme care and under the supervision of medical personnel.</li></ul><b>Anti-inflammatory Drugs</b><ul><li>Includes aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (for example, Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve).</li><li>May be used to reduce swelling and irritation as well as to relieve pain.</li><li>Also includes prescription steroidal drugs (e.g. cortisone, prednisone) used to treat more serious inflammatory conditions.</li></ul> <b>Antidepressants</b><ul><li>Used for chronic pain and pain due to nerve damage in SCI or amputation.</li><li>Newer medications (for example, Cymbalta) are particularly helpful.</li><li>May also help induce restful sleep.</li></ul><b>Anti-seizure medications</b><ul><li>Used for chronic pain.</li><li>May relieve what some patients describe as "shooting" or “burning” pain caused by damaged nerves as well as aching pain.</li></ul><b>Injections</b><ul><li>Local anesthetics (such as Novocain), can be injected around nerve roots and directly into muscles or joints.</li><li>Used to reduce swelling, muscle spasms and abnormal nerve activity that can cause pain.</li></ul><h4>Hot and Cold Compresses</h4><b>Heat</b><ul><li>Electric heating pad or hot water bottle applied to the site of the pain may give relief.</li><li>At temperatures over 104F, heat blocks the effect of chemical messengers that cause the body to detect pain.</li><li>Increases the blood flow to the injured area which brings nutrients to damaged tissues.</li><li>Reduces joint and muscle stiffness.</li><li>Note: heat should not be applied immediately after an injury.</li></ul><b>Cold Compresses</b><ul><li>Relieves pain by numbing the affected area.</li><li>Reduces swelling and inflammation.</li><li>Reduces bleeding.</li></ul>Some people find more relief with cold compresses than with heat, and vice versa. Some people prefer moist heat while some prefer dry heat. Experiment to see which treatment works best for you.<h4>Acupuncture, Acupressure, and Massage</h4><b>Acupuncture</b><ul><li>In this treatment, sterilized stainless steel needles are inserted into the skin at specific points on the body.</li><li>Approved by the National Institutes of Health for the treatment of chronic pain.</li><li>May be helpful with phantom limb pain.</li></ul><b>Acupressure</b><ul><li>Pressure is applied to special acupressure points in the body.</li><li>May help with musculoskeletal pain.</li></ul><b>Massage</b><ul><li>Therapeutic massage may disrupt the transmission of pain signals to the brain.</li><li>May stimulate the release of endorphins (the body’s natural painkillers).</li><li>Reduces stress and promotes relaxation.</li></ul><b>Electrical Stimulation (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)</b><ul><li>Low-voltage electrical current is transmitted through electrodes that are taped to the skin near the painful area.</li><li>The electric current may prevent pain signals from reaching the brain.</li><li>May help phantom limb pain.</li></ul><h4>Hypnosis</h4><b>Hypnotherapy</b><ul><li>A state of deep relaxation that leaves the mind open to suggestions of pain relief.</li><li>Approved by the National Institutes of Health as a pain control method.</li><li>May be useful with both acute and chronic pain.</li><li>May also reduce anxiety associated with painful procedures such as burn treatment.</li></ul><b>Autohypnosis</b><ul><li>A state of hypnosis or deep relaxation which is self-induced. Pain relief or stress relief suggestions can be self-administered.</li><li>May also be used to induce a state of relaxation or distraction from pain.</li></ul> <b>Virtual Reality</b><ul><li>Very promising new treatment for pain in which the user wears a headset with goggles and earphones and explores a computer-generated world or plays a computer game.</li><li>Treatment is used during painful procedures such as burn dressing changes.</li><li>Involvement in the virtual world distracts the user’s attention from the painful procedure.</li></ul> <b>Stress Reduction</b><ul><li>Stress tends to intensify both chronic and acute pain and, in turn, pain intensifies stress.</li><li>This can lead to an upward spiral of increasing pain and stress.</li><li>One way to break the cycle is to reduce pain through methods listed above.</li><li>Another way to break this cycle is to reduce stress using stress management techniques.</li></ul> <b>Deep Breathing Technique</b><ul><li>Slow, deep breathing from the abdomen instead of shallow breathing from the chest.</li><li>Reduces heart rate and other physical signs of tension.</li></ul><b>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</b><ul><li>Tensing and relaxing muscle groups progressively throughout the body.</li><li>Releases the muscle tension associated with increased pain.</li><li>Stress can also lead to sleep difficulties. Failure to get adequate rest may intensify pain. Finally, post-traumatic stress, including unwanted flashbacks to the event that caused the injury, may also increase pain</li></ul><b>Physical Activity</b><br><br>Physical activity is one of the most potent pain relievers. Staying active distracts your mind and reduces the attention you can devote to pain. Physical activity also reduces stress, increases muscle and cardiovascular tone, and may increase the release of endorphins —the brain’s natural pain killers.<br><br>All kinds of physical activity—from washing dishes and mowing the lawn to sports such as skiing and hiking—are beneficial. A wide array of activities is now accessible to Service Members with amputations or who are in wheelchairs. Of course, check with your doctor before beginning a new or strenuous activity. For more information on activities check out:<br><br><ul> <li>Disabled Sports USA - <a href="http://www.dsusa.org/about-overview.html">http://www.dsusa.org/about-overview.html</a></li><li>Military instep - <a href="http://www.amputee-coalition.org/military-instep/sports-recreation-resources.html">http://www.amputee-coalition.org/military-instep/sports-recreation-resou...</a></li><li>Sports and Recreation webpage of the Paralyzed Veterans Association - <a href="http://www.pva.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sports_main">http://www.pva.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sports_main.</a></li></ul>A large part of successfully dealing with pain is up to you. Take an active role in establishing an effective pain-control strategy, and remember the following:<ul> <li>Don’t use tobacco products if you have a spinal injury.</li><li>Use of tobacco can contribute directly to back and leg pain due to degenerative disc disease.</li><li>Don’t try to self-medicate the pain by overusing alcohol.</li><li>Don’t try to “tough out” the pain. Pain is treatable; don’t expend your personal resources fighting pain when you could be using them in other aspects of your rehabilitation.</li><li>Let your doctor know when you experience new or unremitting pain. If one type of treatment doesn’t work, don’t become discouraged. Be open to trying different treatments or combinations of treatments until you find something that works for you.</li></ul>',

    text: '<h2>Dealing with Others</h2>Service members who have been injured or disabled may find that they need to learn new skills or new ways of dealing with others to get what they need or to avoid undesirable reactions. Some situations that a service member may have to deal with include:<ul><li>Handling unwanted attention effectively.</li><li>Asking for help and making requests in a direct and open way.</li><li>Developing new relationships.</li></ul><h3>Handling Unwanted Attention</h3>Visible injuries such as burns and amputations, or an injury requiring a wheelchair to get around,will attract attention. It’s important to know how to handle stares or curiosity about your injury, andwhat to do when someone makes fun of you or your injury.<h3>When Someone Stares</h3><ul> <li><b>Accept it as part of human nature.</b> Humans are hard-wired to pay attention to anything out of the ordinary, so your injuries may naturally draw attention. Remember that most people will stare out of curiosity, compassion, or concern—not rudeness.</li><li><b>Retain control over the situation.</b> Don’t give power over your life to others. You can’t control their staring but you CAN control your reaction to their staring.</li><li>Use the STEPS tool.<sup>1</sup></li></ul>Whenever you are out in public, you can influence the way people respond to you by projecting confidence. When people see that you are self-assured and friendly, they will begin to focus on you rather than the visible signs of your injuries. Practice the following steps until they become natural and automatic.<br><br><b>S=Self-talk (make it positive)</b>—“I accept myself and I’m comfortable with other people.”<br><br><b>T=Tone of voice </b>—Friendly, warm, enthusiastic.<br><br><b>E=Eye contact</b>—Look people in the eye.<br><br><b>P=Posture—Head raised</b>, shoulders back.<br><br><b>S=Smile</b>—Confident but approachable.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Adapted from Quayle, Barbara Kammerer, M.A. Be Your BEST. The Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors. <a href="http://www.phoenix-society.org/downloads/best/ryr_handouts.pdf">http://www.phoenix-society.org/downloads/best/ryr_handouts.pdf</a><h3>When Someone is Curious About Your Injury</h3>When people ask about your injury, be ready with a prepared answer. This will reduce any feelings of embarrassment or anger you might have, and will make the situation less awkward <sup>1</sup>.Here is a three-part approach:<br><br>1. A statement reflecting how, when, or where you were injured.<br><br>Example : “<b>I was injured in an explosion in Baghdad.</b>”<br><br>2. A statement reflecting how you are doing now.<br><br>Example : “<b>I’m doing better now.</b>” Or: “<b>I have one more surgery but I’m doing better.</b>”<br><br>3. A statement reflecting that you appreciate the other person’s concern and that closes the topic.<br><br>Example: “<b>Thanks for asking.</b>” Or: “<b>Thank you for your concern.</b>” Rehearse your entire response until it feels natural and friendly (not hostile).<br><br>Example: “<b>I was injured in an explosion in Baghdad. I was in the hospital for a couple of months, but I’m doing better now. Thanks for asking.</b>” If a person asks for more information you don’t want to provide, be ready with a prepared answer.<br><br>Example: “<b>That’s all I care to say about it today. I’m sure you understand.</b>”<br><br><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/assertiveness/how-to-be-more-assertive-part5.html">http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/assertiveness/how-to-be-more-assertive-part5.html</a><h3>When Someone Makes Fun of Your Injury</h3>If someone makes fun of your disability, it’s natural for you to want to defend yourself or attack. But usually this only fuels the fire and encourages more rude remarks. So even though it might go against your nature, at least initially, try to respond in a way that both stops your heckler and maintains your self-respect. As you get good at this you may actually come to enjoy it.<br><br>· <b>When possible IGNORE put-downs</b>. Yeah – this can be a tough one to do, especially for someone trained to take control of adversarial situations. But if you respond to a heckler with aggression or defensiveness, chances are you’ll just escalate an already unpleasant encounter. He probably wants a “rise” out of you, so don’t give it to him. Ignoring put-downs is actually the high road to take.<br><br>· <b>Use humor to diffuse the situation.</b> Come up with a humorous response to put-downs about your injury ahead of time and then practice it so that it’s automatic.<br><br>Example: Robert sustained burns to his face and upper body during deployment.<br><br><b>Put-down:</b> “Hey, Dude, don’t look now but someone stole your face.”<br><br><b>Response:</b> “Yeah, I guess I got too much sun on that beach in Iraq last year.”<br><br>Robert’s humorous line diffused the situation, while winning the respect of onlookers.<br><br>· <b>Use negative assertion</b><sup>2</sup> to diffuse the situation. This involves acknowledging the truthful part of the put-down while turning it into a positive statement.<br><br>Example : Robert sustained burns to his face and upper body during deployment.<br><br><b>Put-down:</b> “Hey, Dude, it must be pretty hard to eat ice cream with that face.”<br><br><b>Response:</b> “You’re not kidding. It was hard to eat for a long time after the explosion, but I’m getting better at it now.”<br><br>Robert’s negative assertion indicated that he was not intimidated by the put-down, while thoroughly diffusing a potentially difficult situation. You can prepare a negative assertion ahead of time and practice it.<br><br><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/assertiveness/how-to-be-more-assertive-part5.html">http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/assertiveness/how-to-be-more-assertive-part5.html</a><h3>Asking for Help and Making Requests in a Direct and Open Way <sup>3</sup></h3>Your goal as an injured service member is to become as independent as possible. However, there are times when you will need to ask other people for help. It’s important that you ask for help in a direct, assertive, and unembarrassed manner. And remember: most people enjoy contributing to other people’s welfare. A direct request for help can actually be received as a gift.<br><br>Direct requests have three parts:<br><br>1) State your needs: “I need to get to the doctor’s office tomorrow.”<br><br>2) Make the request: “Would you be able to drive me?”<br><br>3) Positively acknowledge the other person’s response: “Thank you. I really appreciate it.” Or: “I totally understand. I’ll see if Justin can do it.”<br><br>Exercise: Make a list of things that you need help with because of your injury. Write out a script for a direct request for each item using the threepart request approach listed above. Then rehearse each request until it becomes automatic. The next time you need to ask for a favor, you will be able to do so in a direct, confident, and open manner.<br><br><sup>3</sup> <a href="http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/assertiveness/how-to-be-moreassertive-part5.html">http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/assertiveness/how-to-be-moreassertive-part5.html</a><h3>Developing New Relationships</h3>Having a broad base of social support is very important for all Service Members, and even more important for those who have injuries. Relationships with others will keep you from becoming withdrawn or isolated. You may meet many new potential friends during hospitalization, through support groups, recreational activities, and involvement in community activities. Here are some ways to build positive relationships with new acquaintances and strengthen existing relationships:<br><br>Remember to use the <b>STEPS Tool </b><sup>3</sup> when you are out in public or meeting new people:<br><br><b>Be a good listener.</b> Instead of planning what you are going to say while the other person is speaking, listen carefully to what they are saying. Every once in a while in the conversation try to put what they are saying in your own words and repeat it back to them. You can use phrases like, “What I hear you saying is…” Or: “You seem to be saying… is that right?” This allows the other person to feel understood.<br><br><b>Ask questions</b> that show you are interested in the whole person, not just their work or perhaps their deployment experience. Everyone has a unique personal story to tell: let them know you’re genuinely curious to hear it. If you follow these three guidelines, you’ll let people know that you are comfortable with your injury and that you’d like to get to know them. This will put others at ease and make the task of getting to know each other go more smoothly.<br><br><b>S=Self-talk </b>— “I accept myself and I’m comfortable with other people.”<br><br><b>T=Tone of voice </b>— Friendly, warm, enthusiastic.<br><br><b>E=Eye contact </b>— Look people in the eye.<br><br><b>P=Posture </b>— Head raised, shoulders back.<br><br><b>S=Smile </b>— Confident but approachable.<br><br><sup>3</sup> Adapted from Barbara Kammerer Quayle, M.A. Be Your BEST.

    text: '<h2>Adjusting to Injury</h2>Adjusting to a deployment injury can be painful and difficult, particularly if the injury was disabling or disfiguring. Adjusting may take months, or even years. The good news is that many service members come through the adjustment feeling stronger and more confident than they did before the injury.<br><br>Stages of AcceptanceWhile accepting the consequences of an injury is an individual process, there are many aspects of healing that are shared among all persons who experience a deployment-related injury. On average, it can take from several months to two years for someone to accept the consequences of an injury. Acceptance is affected by a number of factors:<ul><li>The severity of the injury.</li><li>The severity of the disability.</li><li>The pre-injury characteristics of the individual.</li></ul>The following steps to acceptance are similar to the steps associated with grieving:<ul><li>Initial Reaction — this can take two forms:</li><ul> <li>Shock—emotional numbness and difficulty comprehending the severity of the injury.</li><li>Genuine Relief—relief over surviving the event that caused the injury, or relief over no longer being in theater.</li></ul><li>Denial—the belief that the effects of the injury are reversible and pre-injury functioning and appearance will be fully recovered.</li><li>Anger—feelings of rage at the unfairness of the injury, and blaming others, fate, or God.</li><li>Guilt—feeling guilt either for some part of the event that caused the injury, or guilt for having survived the event when others perished (survivor’s guilt).</li><li>Depression—feeling hopeless or down about the injury, avoiding people, not wanting to get up in the morning, a “What’s the use?” attitude.</li><li>Acceptance—successfully coming to terms with the injury and its future implications With acceptance comes looking ahead – focusing on things other than the injury and a willingness to plan for the future and begin setting goals.</li></ul>The good news is that many service members come through the adjustment feeling stronger and more confident than they did before the injury.<h3>The “New Self”</h3>If you were disabled or disfigured during deployment, it’s quite natural for you to compare your physical appearance or abilities to your pre-injured self, or to others. But to recover and thrive, you’ve got to let this go: you’ve got to develop a new image of yourself, a positive “self image” that doesn’t depend on comparisons to anyone, including the “old you.” Why is this so important?<ul><li>To achieve the personal and professional goals you’ve set for yourself.</li><li>To have healthy social relationships with family and friends.</li><li>To promote your own health and recovery from injury.</li></ul><h3>Accepting a New Body Image</h3><ul><li>Instead of comparing your body to that of someone else or to the “old you,” turn your attention to your personal development, including your talents, skills, abilities, desires, passions, interests, and strength of character.</li><li>Look in the mirror at yourself each day for at least five minutes with your injuries fully uncovered and in full view. Repeat the following phrases:</li><ul><li>“I accept myself.”</li><li>“I am strong.”</li><li>“This body works for me and I work for my body.”</li></ul><li>Be assertive with people who are critical about your body.</li><li>Seek out supportive relationships with people who accept you for who you are.</li><li>Focus on what your body can do (such as touch those you love), instead of what it cannot do.</li><li>Take good care of and respect your body. Make sure your body gets nourishing food, good rest, and whatever exercise your doctor approves.</li><li>Look for the inner beauty in others rather than judging them by their outward appearance.</li><li>Don’t buy into the media images of perfection that constantly bombard society. Act self-confidently and unembarrassed about your appearance, and you will be <b>educating the public</b> and helping to overcome the unhealthy emphasis the media places on “physical perfection.”</li></ul><h3>Making Sense of the Injury</h3>Service members who can find positive meaning in their sacrifice and who can fit the injury and why it happened into their world view have a greater sense of well-being and fewer problems with anxiety and depression. Challenging yourself to think about the injury can have a positive effect on your life. For example, search for a positive direction to be explored because of the injury. Have you learned to appreciate small things that maybe you’ve taken for granted in the past? Many service members look to their faith to help them find meaning. You made a sacrifice…your job now is to discover what will be made better because of that sacrifice.<h3>Setting Goals for the Future</h3>Once you have accepted and made sense of your injury, <b>you can begin to look at your life in terms of possibilities rather than limitations</b>, and you can begin to set goals for the future.<br><br><b>1) Choose the goal.</b> Write it down. Make sure it is your goal, not someone else’s goal for you.<br><br><b>2) Create a plan for completion.</b> Write down all the intermediate steps you’ll need to accomplish, put them in chronological order, and set a timetable for completion of each step. Schedule in time for unexpected setbacks.<br><br><b>3) Do a reality check.</b> Your plan should be challenging but doable. It should be feasible as far as money and time are concerned.<br><br><b>4) Begin as soon as possible,</b> but pace yourself. Try to march slowly and steadily toward your goal. Schedule the time into your calendar on a regular basis to make sure the journey toward your goal remains a priority.<h3>Returning to the Community</h3><b>After accepting your injury and setting new expectations for the future, your next step is to “get back out there.” This includes returning to employment, enjoying recreational activities, and participating in community events.Employment</b><br><br>Returning to employment will increase your self-esteem, increase your personal independence, reduce reliance on others, and help make you financially independent and secure.<ul><li>First, decide whether you are capable of returning to the job you formerly held. If not, are you able to work in some related area where your former expertise can be valuable?</li><li>If you prefer to work in a different field from your former employment, what training or education will you need? Is it realistic to pursue this training?</li><li>When taking a job, consider whether it will allow for advancement, training, or growth. You don’t want to be stuck in an entry-level job for years.</li><li>Do you have interest in this field or are you taking a job simply to have employment? You will perform better and find more satisfaction in a job that really calls to you.</li><li>Remember that individuals with disabilities cannot be denied employment solely on the basis of their disability if they are otherwise able to perform the duties of the position.</li></ul><h3>Recreational Activities</h3>Thanks to modern advancements in prosthetics, mechanical aides, specialized sports equipment, and access laws, individuals with burns, spinal cord injuries, and amputations have the opportunity to participate in a very extensive range of recreational activities, including team sports, golf, canoeing, dancing, cycling, skiing, wilderness trips, bowling, and ice skating, to name a few.<h3>Community Involvement</h3>Getting active in your community is a great way for you to share your valuable knowledge and experience while getting to know your neighbors. What may seem like small beginnings can actually have a big impact, both on your own well being and the well being of your community and the world. Here are some ways to get involved:<sup>1</sup><ul><li><b>Attend town meetings.</b></li><li><b>Volunteer your skills.</b> There are many organizations that could use your help, even if yhttp://www.volunteermatch.orgou have a disability.
